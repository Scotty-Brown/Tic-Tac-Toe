### Wins & Challenges

#### Wins:
- Having freedom of display design for this project let me dive into my curiosities and explore additional functionalities that CSS has to offer
- Seperating my Data Model and Dom intentions when building out this project was a huge win and allowed me to easily identify and fix bugs when they occurred

#### Challenges:
- There were a few instances where I needed to build a relationship between parts of my Data Model and Dom elements and whenever those would occur, the task would seem overwhelming at
first. However, each occurence would uncover new strategies and functionalities that I was not privy to just yet. Although there were challenges, there were many learning opportunities that would follow.
